The basic setup of the jQuery
  Create a variable = jQuery object of (this). An attribute method is concatenated to $(this) with the input value of "data-id". 
  
  A "data-id" number is linked to all the numbers. When the number is clicked, then the javascript is able to take that "data-id" and attach an active class to the display class that has a matching id to the "data-id"
